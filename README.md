# creating-custom-user-in-django
This repository contains a register django app that consist of all that you need to know in creating a custom user model and handling email login of users in python/django.

Tip:
The authentication that comes with Django is good enough for most common cases, but you may have needs not met by the out-of-the-box defaults. 
Customizing authentication in your projects requires understanding what points of the provided system are extensible or replaceable

1. Clone this repository or download and extract it.
2. Add the 'register' folder to your project's root directory.
3. Add 'register' to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
4. Run 'python manage.py makemigrations' in your terminal

NB: This automatically provides you with USER LOGIN WITH EMAIL in django.

Thank you.
